# 4-4 One Million

# Create a list with numbers from 1 to 1mln, then use a 'for' loop to print all the numbers (I wonder if IDE hangs...)

numbers = [value for value in range(1, 1000001)]
print(numbers)

# NOTE: Actually, it didn't hang! Printed out all numbers in about ~3 seconds. Not bad for an 7 years old PC!
